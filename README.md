* Introduction
--In this project, I analyzed a dataset on international debt to understand how much different countries owe, what types of debt exist, and which nations have the highest depts. Using SQL, I wrote queries to answer key questions below.

-- Question 1: How much debt do all the countries in the dataset owe in total?
-- I used SQL to sum up all the debt values in the dataset.
-- The total debt across all countries is in the trillions of dollars, showing that many nations rely heavily on borrowing.

--Question2: How many unique countries are included in the dataset?
-- I counted the number of distinct country names in the dataset.
-- The dataset includes many different countries, making it a strong representation of global debt trends.

--Question3: What are the different debt indicators, and what do they represent?
-- I listed the unique debt indicator names from the dataset.
-- The dataset tracks various types of debt, including:
--External debt stocks: The total amount a country owes.
--Principal repayments: The amount a country has already paid back.
--Interest payments: The extra cost of borrowing money.

-- Question4: Which country has the highest total debt?
-- I summed the debt for each country and sorted the results to find the country with the highest amount.
-- The most indebted country owes hundreds of billions of dollars, raising concerns about its ability to repay.

--Question5: What is the average debt across different debt categories?
-- I calculated the average debt for each type of debt indicator.
-- Some debt indicators, like external debt stocks, have much higher average values than others, suggesting that this type of debt is the biggest contributor to financial obligations.

--Question6: Which country has repaid the most debt?
-- I filtered the data to focus only on principal repayments and found the country with the highest total repayments.
-- One country has paid back billions, possibly due to strong financial management or high debt obligations.

-- Question7: Which debt indicator appears the most across all countries?
-- I counted the number of times each debt indicator appears in the dataset and sorted the results.
-- The most commonly recorded type of debt is external debt stocks, meaning most countries track their total outstanding debt as a key financial measure.

-- Question 8: Exploring Additional Debt Trends
-- Debt by region – Some regions owe far more than others.

* Conclusion:
--The total global debt is enormous, showing how much countries rely on borrowing.
-- Some countries have extremely high debt, while others are paying it back at a fast rate.
-- External debt stocks are the most common type of debt.
-- Global debt levels are continuously increasing, highlighting potential financial risks.
